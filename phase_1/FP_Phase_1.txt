1. Team Members: Julian Dorsey & Meena Reddy
2. Target domain: a database of music reviews/chart rankings (sourced from Billboard and Pitchfork)
3. Questions to Answer:
   1. Billboard: 
      1. According to Billboard, who is the most popular artist of each decade?
      2. Which artist has the highest average song ranking on the Billboard Hot 100?
      3. For each decade, which artist was featured the most times on the Hot 100? 
      4. What is the most commonly used word amongst song titles of Hot 100 songs?
   1. Pitchfork: 
      1. Which artist has the highest/lowest average rating on Pitchfork?
      2. Which genre has the highest/lowest average review rating on Pitchfork for each year?
      3. What was the change in average rating for pop albums from 1980 to 2015?
      4. What is the average album rating given by each reviewer?
      5. What is the average rating for “Best New Music” songs/albums compared to music that was not “Best New Music?”’
   1. Combined: 
      1. How many songs that charted above 50 on the Billboard rankings received scores above 7 on Pitchfork?
      2. Which contributor best predicted how an album’s songs would chart? Assume that a score above 7 is a marker of an album’s quality. 
      3. Return all the songs that were awarded ‘Best New Music’ and also charted on Billboard. 
   1. NLP/data science: 
      1. What is the average ranking for songs about ‘love’ compared to songs not about love? 
      2. Is the Pitchfork review consistent with the numerical score (using some sentiment analysis scheme)? 
      3. Based on a song’s genre and its Pitchfork rating, can we predict how it will chart on Billboard?

1. Loading database with values: 
   1. We will obtain Billboard data from: https://www.kaggle.com/rakannimer/billboard-lyrics
   2. We will obtain Pitchfork data from https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data/version/1
   3. These are both .csv files, which can be easily imported into mySQL using Workbench or a similar tool. 
   4. We will need to find a way to correlate the song (on Billboard) with its album, and are looking into solutions for this. 
1. We will have pre-formatted inputs through which the user can submit parameters for various queries, and will display the results as views or tables. 
2. We plan to focus on data mining, including basic machine learning and natural language processing and will also touch on data presentation using Python libraries.
